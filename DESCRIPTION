Description: This groundbreaking technical indicator directly integrates volatility into price averaging by weighting median range-bound prices using the True Range.  Unlike conventional metrics such as TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price), which focuses solely on time, or VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price), which emphasizes volume, 'TrueWAP' captures fluctuating market behavior by reflecting true price movement within high/low performance boundaries.
